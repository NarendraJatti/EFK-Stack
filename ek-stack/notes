 Kubernetes supports various volume types such as PersistentVolumeClaim, hostPath, emptyDir, ConfigMap, and more.
volumes is a pod-level setting. It defines the storage that is available for the containers in that pod. Multiple containers in the same pod can share the same volume. volumeMounts is a container-level setting. It specifies how the volume should be attached to the container. You can define multiple volumeMounts per container, each mounting a different part of the storage.

How This Works:
PersistentVolumes (PVs) are tied to specific nodes using hostPath and node affinity.
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) generated by the StatefulSet will bind to available PVs that match their criteria (like storage size and access mode).
Since each pod in the StatefulSet is scheduled on a different node due to node affinity, its associated PVC will bind to the PV on that node.
Thus, each Elasticsearch pod will have its data stored on the respective nodeâ€™s local storage directory, managed by the PersistentVolume. This ensures separation of storage across nodes.
